# Definition of Ready (DoR) & Definition of Done (DoD)

## Purpose

Make workflow rules explicit so board movement is consistent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

An issue may be moved to **Ready** only if:

-   [ ] Acceptance criteria are clearly defined\
-   [ ] Dependencies are identified and linked (if any)\
-   [ ] A size label is assigned (S / M / L or equivalent)

If any of the above is missing, the issue remains in **Backlog**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Definition of Done (DoD)

An issue may be moved to **Done** only if:

-   [ ] Pull Request (PR) is merged\
-   [ ] All checks/tests pass\
-   [ ] Documentation is updated (if needed)

If any item is incomplete, the issue remains in **In Review** or **In
Progress**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Review Rule (Mandatory)

-   A **different team member** must review and approve the PR before
    merge.\
-   The author of the PR cannot self-approve.
